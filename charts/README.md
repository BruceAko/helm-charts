# Charts

helm charts use helm-docs to generate helm documents. [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs) need to rely on installing [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit).

## Pre-commit

### Install `pre-commit`

Using homebrew:

```bash
$ brew install pre-commit
```

Using pip:

```bash
$ pip install pre-commit
```

### Install `git hooks`

```bash
$ pre-commit install
```
